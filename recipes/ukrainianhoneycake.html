        <p>A Ukrainian honey cake, also sometimes known as medovik, features thin layers of honey-flavored cake made from a thin dough, which is rolled out into circles and baked individually until golden.
        Each layer is coated with a sour cream frosting, stacked and then allowed to rest overnight, softening the cake. The exterior is then covered with more sour cream frosting and the baked and crushed scraps from the layers. My family are in part Ukrainian I was recently asked to make a cake in aid of a fundraiser to support the people effected by the war in Ukraine, this cake took a lot of practice but its one of my favorites now. </p>

        <h2>Get Ahead</h2>
            <ol>

                <li>Prepare two sheet pans with silicone baking mats or parchment paper.</li>
            </ol>

                <li>Remove from heat and stream in beaten eggs while whisking. Add baking soda and salt.</li>
                <li>Add flour gradually until a dough forms; divide into 8 pieces.</li>
                <li>Roll out each piece on a floured surface and use a 6-inch cutter to punch out circles. Bake for 3-5 minutes until golden.</li>
                <li>Cool circles on a rack and bake scraps until golden. Crush for garnish.</li>
            </ol>

                <li>Whip heavy cream until stiff peaks form.</li>
                <li>Whisk sour cream, vanilla, and powdered sugar. Fold in whipped cream.</li>
            </ol>
        <h2>Assemble the Cake</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Place frosting in the mold, add a cake layer, and top with more frosting. Repeat with remaining layers.</li>
