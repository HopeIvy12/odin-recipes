    <img src="https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/panettone-50f77b4.jpg?quality=90&webp=true&resize=300,272" alt="A traditional dried fruit Panettone" height="300" width="400">
    <p>Panettone is a traditional Italian sweet bread, often enjoyed during holidays, particularly Christmas and New Year's. This recipe came to mind as buying Christmas presents and my Nonna would always make sure we had Panettone's over the Christmas period. It is characterized by its tall, dome-shaped structure and a rich, airy texture.
        The dough is typically flavored with vanilla, citrus zests, and studded with dried fruits such as raisins and candied orange peel. Panettone is often served sliced, accompanied by coffee or dessert wine. This one contains candied fruit, which is one of the more traditional versions of the panettone.</p>

            <li>80g raisins</li>
            <li>80g sultanas</li>
            <li>3 tbsp dark rum</li>
            <li>100g good-quality candied lemon and orange peel, finely chopped</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>For the topping</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>30g whole blanched almonds, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1 tbsp caster sugar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp egg white</li>
            <li>1 tbsp icing sugar</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Grease a panettone tin or a 20cm deep cake tin, or use a panettone case.</li>
            <li>Place warm milk in a bowl, add yeast and 1 tsp of sugar, and leave for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, beat remaining sugar with butter and vanilla extract until light, creamy, and pale.</li>
            <li>Stir in lemon and orange zest, adding eggs gradually. If the mixture curdles, spoon in a tablespoon of flour.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, mix flour with salt, make a well, and add yeast mixture and butter-egg mixture. Fold to make a soft dough and knead for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn out dough onto a floured surface and knead for another 10 minutes until soft and stretchy. Place in a greased bowl, cover, and refrigerate overnight to prove.</li>
            <li>Heat raisins and sultanas with rum in a saucepan until plump. Set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>Once risen, knead dough for another 5 minutes and incorporate soaked fruits. Shape into a ball and place in the prepared tin. Cover and leave to rise for 3-4 hours until doubled.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 180°C (fan 160°C, gas 4). Mix almonds, caster sugar, and egg white for the topping and brush over the panettone. Bake for 40-50 minutes until golden and a skewer comes out clean. Cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then on a wire rack. Dust with icing sugar before serving.</li>
        </ol>
