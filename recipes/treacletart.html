        <p>Treacle tart is a classic British dessert made with a shortcrust pastry filled with a mixture of golden syrup. Treacle tart is often served warm, it can be enjoyed on its own or with a dollop of clotted cream, custard, or ice cream. The other two recipes I have included have a special memory associated with them, this one however is just what I'm craving ðŸ˜‚.</p>

    <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Sieve the flour and salt into a large bowl. Add the butter and rub together until breadcrumb-like. Stir in icing sugar, then add egg yolks and 2 tbsp water, mixing quickly. Form into a ball, wrap, and chill for 30 mins. Roll out and line a 22cm fluted tart tin with the pastry. Chill for another 30 mins.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Heat a baking sheet in the oven. Line the pastry case with baking parchment and beans, bake for 15 mins. Remove parchment and bake for another 10 mins until golden. Cool and trim edges.</li>
            <li>Lower oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 4. Combine golden syrup, ginger, syrup, lemon, eggs, and breadcrumbs in a bowl. Pour the filling into the pastry case and bake for 35-40 mins until set. Cool for 20 mins before serving with ice cream or clotted cream.</li>
